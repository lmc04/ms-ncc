# Mean-Subtracted Normalized Cross-Correlation Structured Light
We consider the code generation and code matching of a Structured Light 3D Scanning technique that uses only a few patterns. Phase Shifting codes have proven to be robust and accurate, while other types of codes require extra images for calibration, complex imaging systems, or a sacrifice in depth resolution to lower the number of images. We introduce Mean-Subtracted Normalized Cross-Correlation, a novel technique that is not related to Phase Shifting, but works with a limited number of images. The code matching is robust because albedo is naturally factored out by using normalized codes and effects of global illumination can be canceled out by subtracting the mean of captured images. The code creation assigns each pixel its own code and these codes are optimized to be as uncorrelated with each other as possible. The creation of codes is very flexible since the maximum frequency of the projected patterns can be limited and the number of projections used can be set. Due to the way the codes are created, the matching algorithm is just a mean, a subtraction, and a cross-correlation for each pixel. This leads to a very fast matching and can even be used to match codes from other techniques. We demonstrate that our technique works with at least 4 patterns using both simulated and real images.
